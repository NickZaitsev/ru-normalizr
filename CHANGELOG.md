# Changelog

All notable changes to `ru-normalizr` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project follows Semantic Versioning.

## Unreleased
### Changed
- Fix some 'к → Кельвин' and 'м в → милливольт' misnormalization errors. Add regression coverage for ambiguous single-letter units and compound unit boundaries such as `км ч`, `квт ч`, `fps`, `mph`, `kbps`, `об мин`, and `ммоль л`
- Explicitly treat `не более`, `не менее`, `не больше`, `не меньше`, `более`, `менее`, `больше`, and `меньше` as genitive-marking quantifiers only in direct continuous use before numerals, without extending that rule through `чем`
- Preserve bracketed year-like values during TTS link removal, improve range/year case handling (`1990-ые`, `1943 и 1951 гг.`, `206 год до н. э.`), and add `ул.`/`Св.` expansions
- Keep hyphenated decade forms such as `в 1990-ые годы` out of the implicit preposition-plus-year rule so they stay decade phrases instead of becoming `девяностом-ые`
- Move implicit year disambiguation out of year regexes into shared token/context helpers, and keep `с 1990 по 1995 кг`-style measurement ranges from being misread as year ranges
- Keep implicit year heuristics from misreading measurement and currency ranges such as `от 1200 до 10000 МПа`, `от 1200 до 10000 ₽`, and spaced-thousands forms like `от 1200 до 10 000 МПа`, while reusing shared unit/currency lexicons from `numerals._constants`
- Restore `с/со/от ... до|по ... г.` year-range normalization so explicit trailing year abbreviations keep both range endpoints in year morphology
- Read `=` as `равно` in math-like expressions when at least one side contains digits, covering forms such as `t=10` and `x=(2+3)` while leaving plain non-numeric assignments such as `x = y` unchanged
- Read `~` as `примерно` before numeric expressions and treat compact lowercase `k` suffixes such as `250k` as thousands while keeping uppercase `K` for Kelvin units
- Fix agreement for compound adjective+noun measurement units after numerals, so outputs such as `3 м^3`, `2 км2`, and `2 IU` normalize to `три кубических метра`, `два квадратных километра`, and `две международные единицы`
- Stop misreading title-case `См.` as a Cyrillic Roman numeral token and normalize single chapter/section-style references such as `главу 10`, `из главы 10`, and `из раздела 3` to ordinal forms like `главу десятую`, `из главы десятой`, and `из раздела третьего`
- Inflect adjective-like abbreviations such as `гос.`, `междунар.`, and `полит.` from the following noun phrase so forms like `гос. контроля` normalize to `государственного контроля`
- Expand English title abbreviations `Mr.` and `Mrs.` to `мистер` and `миссис` before latinization, so mixed inputs such as `Mr. Поппер` normalize cleanly
- Normalize `&` contextually as `и` in Russian phrases and as `энд` in brand-like English letter-name contexts such as `AT&T`
- Route safe `число-дефис-единица` forms such as `35-мм`, `35 - мм`, and `1,5-мл` through shared numeral hyphen handling so they normalize like spaced units while leaving ordinary forms such as `20-этажный` and ambiguous single-letter suffixes alone
- Keep preprocess from eagerly converting ASCII ` - ` into `—`; only normalize explicit dash characters there, canonize numeric `число - suffix/unit` forms such as `35 - мм`, `20 - этажный`, and `5 - й` before numeral handling, and move leftover ASCII word-separator dashes to finalize so plain spaced ranges like `10 - 20` stay range-like
- Restrict implicit `от/с ... до/по ...` year-range normalization without explicit `год/г./гг.` to plausible years only, and expand single initials near likely surnames in TTS mode while leaving obvious non-person tokens such as `С. Петербург` untouched
- Read regnal name patterns such as `Георг VI`, `Людовик XVI`, `Елизавета II`, and `Дарий I` as ordinal names (`Георг шестой`, `Людовик шестнадцатый`, etc.) instead of cardinal numerals
- Preserve full Greek-script words such as `αστατος` instead of spelling them out letter-by-letter, while still reading standalone Greek symbols like `α`, and expand `от греч./лат. <foreign word>` to forms such as `от греческого αστατος` and `от латинского homo`
- Rewrite explicit Cyrillic combining stress marks such as `Фри́дрих А́вгуст` to the package's `+` stress format (`Фр+идрих +Август`) during preprocess instead of letting combining accents break token spacing

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-15
### Changed
- Update repo name to `ru-normalizr`.
- Fix CI/CD
- Add GUI link to README.md

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-15
### Changed
- Changed release helper scripts.
- Moved decimal and fraction normalization from the `dates_time` stage to `numerals`.
- `enable_numeral_normalization=False` now keeps decimal numbers unchanged instead of normalizing them through `dates_time`
### Fixed.
- Bracketed numeric references are no longer expanded during preprocess when `remove_links=False`; they now stay unchanged unless link removal is enabled.


## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-14
### Changed
- Updated README.md.
- Fixed incorrect repository/homepage links in PyPI metadata.
- Cleaned up lint issues and added release helper scripts.
- Added GitHub Actions CI and tag-based PyPI release automation.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- Fixed quote space normalization.
- Updated Readme and project description.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Initial standalone `ru_normalizr` package extracted from private TTS workflow.
- Public Python API: `normalize`, `Normalizer`, `normalize_batch`, `run_stage`, and `preprocess_text`.
- Standalone CLI via `python -m ru_normalizr` and `ru-normalizr`.
- Fixed-order normalization pipeline for:
  - preprocess cleanup
  - Roman numerals
  - years, dates, and time
  - cardinal numerals, ordinals, decimals, fractions, and hyphenated numeric words
  - abbreviations, initials, and letter-by-letter expansions
  - optional dictionary normalization
  - optional Latin transliteration
- Native dictionary loader for `.dic` files.
- Library test suite moved into `ru_normalizr/tests`.
- Package metadata, typing marker, and wheel build support.
- PEP8 formatted.
- `NormalizeOptions.safe()` and `NormalizeOptions.tts()` presets.
- Granular abbreviation toggles for contextual abbreviations, initials, and letter-by-letter expansions.
- Optional IPA stress marker output controlled by `enable_latinization_stress_marks`.
- CLI support for `--mode safe|tts` and `--with-latin-stress`.


### Changed
- Consolidated morphology loading through a shared cached helper.
- Expanded parity coverage against legacy normalization behavior.
- `NormalizeOptions()` now defaults to the conservative `safe` preset.
- TTS-oriented behavior is now explicit through `NormalizeOptions.tts()` or `--mode tts`.
- Latinization rules were moved to `ru_normalizr/dictionaries/latinization/latinization_rules.dic`.
- General dictionary normalization no longer implicitly loads the latinization dictionary subtree unless it is explicitly requested.

### Notes
- TTS-specific pause hacks, pronunciation logic, accentization, and audio/model integration remain intentionally out of scope. ru-normalizr is only handling book normalization.
